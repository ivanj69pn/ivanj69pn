# 👋 Yo, I'm @ivanj69pn - The Digital Thug

Sup fam! I'm Ivan, an Eastern European thug in the coding game, disrupting the tech scene one byte at a time. Here's the lowdown:

## 👀 I'm interested in...

Cooking up wicked code, gaming like a boss, and staying ahead of the tech curve. From the mean streets of Eastern Europe to the vast cyberspace, I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing.

## 🌱 I'm currently learning...

The art of domination in [Insert current tech interest here]. Elevating my skills to the next level because in this game, you either evolve or get left in the digital dust.

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...

Projects that pack a punch! If you got a crazy idea or need someone to bring the heat to your code, let's team up and make waves in the tech underworld.

## 😄 Pronouns:

Thug Life

## ⚡ Fun fact:

I once coded a bot to drop virtual mic bombs in the digital streets. Yeah, I'm that kinda thug. Watch out!
